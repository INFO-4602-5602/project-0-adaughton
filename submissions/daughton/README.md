## Project 0 - INFO VIZ

### Project specifications
Part 1: Done
Part 2: Done
Part 3 & 4: Done
Part 5: Done

In an attempt to write less redundant code, I wrote a more generic scatterplot function and simply implemented it slightly differently in parts 3 through 5. The code is commented to reflect this in a (hopefully) clear manner.

### Bells and Whistles
# Bell: Tooltips
Tooltips have been implemented in addition to labels printed out in the ScatterplotLabel div. Of note, you have to click the first point twice. I'm not sure why.

# Bell: Styling the viz
I added to the css, mostly to just get some more experience with css. The background reminded me of mint chocolate chip ice cream, which is the predominate inspiration. Also of note, for some reason I haven't quite figured out yet, my chrome browser wouldn't load my css file. So, I added all the css to the top of the .html file.

#Whistle: Transition
Part 3 and 4 (B) has a menu that allows you to transition between the various datasets.
